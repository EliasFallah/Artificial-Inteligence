My huristic function is a conflict-based huristic that finds the number of missmatched pairs of tiles and increases the cost of that states heuristic.
    For each 'W' tile:
        Count the number of 'B' tiles to the left of it.
    
    For each 'B' tile:
        Count the number of 'W' tiles to the right of it.

This heuristic promotes puzzle states that have less conflicts and helps the A* search function get closer to the goal state.
